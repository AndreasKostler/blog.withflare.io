I LOVE to ride motorbikes. I seriously do - and I'm not alone: Almost 9 Million Americans enjoy two wheels, here in Australia more then 700000 motorbikes are registered.
Over the years I've owned a Vespa PX 80 (it's a manual, counts, righ?, a Yamaha DT 80, a Kawasaki ZZR 250, a Suzuki DL 650, and my most recent edition a Triumph Speed Triple 1050. I easily clock up 10k miles per year. I commute on my bike, I blast through the hills, and I do my shopping with my bike. But most of all I like to cruise the beautiful country I'm living in. To say it with Robert Pirsig's words: "You see things vacationing on a motorcycle in a way that is completely different from any other. In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realize that through that car window everything you see is just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame."
Taking in the surrounds is the closest I come to a state of  'Zen'. Sometimes I ride for 30 minutes without encountering a single vehicle. Towns can be as far as an hour apart. This state of 'Zen' allows me to ponder. Recently, on a trip from Adelaide to Melbourne, a thought crossed my mind. A thought unpopular with every motorcyclist - The dreaded 'What if?'
What if I crash out here? Now I'm not one to paint horror scenarios, exaggerating the potential dangers of riding a motorbike, but I am not oblivious to them either. 
At fault or not, it might be several minutes until someone arrives at the scene. Several more minutes for that someone to assess the situation and call the ambulance. 
Precious minutes wasted if you're lying in the ditch with severe trauma, concussed, and potentially loosing blood. While nothing can be done to reduce the time it takes the ambulance to get to the scene after it has been notified it should be possible to reduce the time it takes from the crash to making the emergency call.

When I got home on that day I did some research: In 2008, the Association for Advancement of Automotive Medicine (AAAM) published a study investigating the effectiveness of Automated Crash Notification (ACN) systems concluding that the percentage of road fatalities is proportional to the reduction in crash notification time according to the following formula: PF = DANT/ANT * 0.14. 
According to the table below, 7 minutes pass on average between the occurrence of a crash and emergency services receiving the distress call in rural areas (4 minutes for urban areas).

This means that if this number can be reduced to 1 minute, the percentage of road fatalities would decrease by 12% (10% in urban areas). These are quite impressive numbers considering there have been over 4000 motorcycle deaths in the US alone in 2011. 
The study further revealed that typical expenses associated with ACN or vehicle telematic systems in general are in the range of 199-299$ per year plus installation costs. Hence, despite the significant impact that ACN is predicted to have on the road toll such systems are relatively rare on our roads.

This need not be: Smartphones equipped with a multitude of sensors are ubiquitous now. Fusion algorithms exist to reliable detect accidents. 
So this is what I set out to do and withflare.io was born. withflare monitors the vehicle state using information provided by the accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, and GPS and, in case of a detected crash, notifies a dedicated emergency contact with the exact location and other useful information such as blood type and medicine allergies. 

withflare.io doesn't stop there: In addition to rapidly notifying emergency contacts of a crash, it also provides vital information about the crash and the rider involved: Exact location, speed at time of the accident, rider age and weight, blood type, allergies, and medical conditions are all vital when trying to safe a persons life.
